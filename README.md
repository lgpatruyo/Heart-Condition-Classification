# Heart Condition Classification

The objective is to prepare a model to predict abnormal heart condition or Miocardial Infartion (MI). 
The model is trained and evaluated on PhysionNet's PTB Diagnostic dataset,  which includes preprocessed EGC signals from 148 patients affected by Myocardial Infarction and 52 patients with normal heart. 
The best model is selected after comparing the performance of several models based on different architectures of neural networks (CNN and LSTM) as well as the XGBoost algorithm.
